    abstract = {Shifting computing architectures from von Neumann to event-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) uncovers new opportunities for low-power processing of real-world problems such as vision or sensorimotor control. Exploring roads toward cognitive on-chip SNNs requires the design of compact, low-power and versatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning in order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However, embedding online learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred complexity and area overheads. In this work, we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} 64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor in 28nm FDSOI CMOS achieving 9.8pJ per synaptic operation (SOP). It leverages an efficient spike-driven synaptic plasticity (SDSP) learning rule implementation that allows to reach a record density with 0.68{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} per synapse with embedded online learning. Neurons can be independently configured as a standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model or as a custom phenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in biological spiking neurons. ODIN thus enables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for low-power, adaptive and low-cost processing.},
